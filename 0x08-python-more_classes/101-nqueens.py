"""
Solves the N-queens puzzle.

Determines all possible solutions to placing N non-attacking queens on an NxN chessboard.

Example:
    $ ./nqueens.py N

N must be an integer greater than or equal to 4.

Attributes:
    board (list): A list of lists representing the chessboard.
    solutions (list): A list of lists containing solutions.

Solutions are represented in the format [[r, c], [r, c], [r, c], [r, c]]
where `r` and `c` represent the row and column, respectively, where a
queen must be placed on the chessboard.
